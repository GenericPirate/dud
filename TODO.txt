Ducfile struct

commands:
    track <targets>
        creates Ducfile showing targets to be added
        (doesn't compute checksums! field is left empty)
    commit <Ducfile>
        reads Ducfile
        for each target:
            checksum target
            move target to cache
            checkout target
        updates Ducfile (including hash for Ducfile itself)
    checkout [Ducfile]
        reads Ducfile
        for each target:
            looks up target hash
            checkout target from cache
    status [Ducfile]
        reads Ducfile
        for each target:
            return status of target:
                in workspace?
                in cache?
                different or the same?
    run <Ducfile> (aka repro)
        ...
        delete targets
            (if a target is persisted, only unprotect)
        ...
        (doesn't compute checksums! fields are left empty)
