## dud fetch

Fetch committed artifacts to the default remote cache

### Synopsis

Fetch downloads previously committed artifacts from a remote cache.

For each stage passed in, fetch downloads the stage's committed outputs from the
remote cache specified in the Dud config file. If no stage files are passed
in, fetch will act on all stages in the index. By default, fetch will act
recursively on all upstream stages (i.e. dependencies).

```
dud fetch [flags] [stage_file]...
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help           help for fetch
  -s, --single-stage   don't recursively operate on dependencies
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --profile   enable profiling
      --trace     enable tracing
```
