## dud graph

Print stage graph in graphviz DOT format

### Synopsis

Graph prints the stage graph in graphviz DOT format.

For each stage file passed in, graph will print the graph of the stage and all
upstream stages. If no stage files are passed in, graph will act on all stages
in the index.

You can pipe the output of this command to 'dot' from the graphviz package to
generate images of the stage graph. For example:

dud graph | dot -Tpng -o dud.png


```
dud graph [flags] [stage_file]...
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help          help for graph
      --stages-only   only show stages; no artifacts
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --profile   enable profiling
      --trace     enable tracing
```
