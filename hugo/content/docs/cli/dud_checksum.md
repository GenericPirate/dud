## dud checksum

Checksum files or bytes from STDIN

### Synopsis

Checksum reads files (or bytes from STDIN) and prints their checksums.

The CLI is intended to be compatible with the *sum family of command-line tools
(although this version is currently incomplete).

```
dud checksum [flags] [file]...
```

### Options

```
  -b, --bufsize int   internal buffer size in bytes
  -h, --help          help for checksum
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

      --profile   enable profiling
      --trace     enable tracing
```
