## dud checkout

Load committed artifacts from the cache

### Synopsis

Checkout loads previously committed artifacts from the cache.

For each stage file passed in, checkout attempts to load all output artifacts
from the cache for the given. If no stage files are passed in, checkout will act on all
stages in the index. By default, checkout will act recursively on all upstream stages
(i.e. dependencies).

```
dud checkout [flags] [stage_file]...
```

### Options

```
  -c, --copy           copy artifacts instead of linking
  -h, --help           help for checkout
  -s, --single-stage   don't recursively operate on dependencies
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --profile   enable profiling
      --trace     enable tracing
```
