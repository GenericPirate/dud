## dud push

Push committed artifacts to the default remote cache

### Synopsis

Push uploads previously committed artifacts to a remote cache.

For each stage passed in, push uploads the stage's committed outputs to the
remote cache specified in the Dud config file. If no stage files are passed
in, push will act on all stages in the index. By default, push will act
recursively on all upstream stages (i.e. dependencies).

```
dud push [flags] [stage_file]...
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help           help for push
  -s, --single-stage   don't recursively operate on dependencies
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --profile   enable profiling
      --trace     enable tracing
```
