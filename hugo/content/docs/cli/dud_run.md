## dud run

Run stages or pipelines

### Synopsis

Run runs stages or pipelines.

For each stage passed in, run executes a stage's command if it is out-of-date.
If no stage files are passed in, run will act on all stages in the index. By
default, run will act recursively on all upstream stages (i.e. dependencies),
and thus run will execute a stage's command if any upstream stages are
out-of-date.

```
dud run [flags] [stage_file]...
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help           help for run
  -s, --single-stage   don't recursively operate on dependencies
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --profile   enable profiling
      --trace     enable tracing
```
